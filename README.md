# RestFulInteractionWebApp
ClientServerRestFull applications interaction Web .net core 2.0 application.
It has no database, instead it uses "mobile.json" file in local directory to maintain data operations.
To run this application correctly you must change port number in url string, example:
private static string url = "http://localhost:57447/api/RestAPI";
My port number here is 57447, you must change this to your own.
